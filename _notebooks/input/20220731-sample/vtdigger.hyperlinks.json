    "text": "CommentaryCommentary policy VTDigger.org publishes 12 to 18 commentaries a week from a broad range of community sources. All commentaries must include the author\u2019s first and last name, town of residence and a brief biography, including affiliations with political parties, lobbying or special interest groups. We have a minimum length of 400 words. We have found the ideal length is approximately 800 to 1,000 words. We provide some copyediting support, but we do not have the staff to fact-check commentaries. We reserve the right to reject opinions for matters of taste and accuracy. Commentaries are voices from the community and do not represent VTDigger in any way. Please send your commentary to Cate Chant, cchant@vtdigger.org and Anne Galloway, agalloway@vtdigger.org.",
